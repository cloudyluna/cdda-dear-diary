THE WORLD HAS GONE NUTS.

LAWS ARE NO MORE.

I have to fend myself off from the monsters...and 
I think the humans are far scarier than those.

Who do I trust??


Wish me luck.

Dear diary,

I just fought a swarm of zombies. Small and big. 
They were though but I managed.

I hope I can make it out.

I just need to fight.

I need to.

Dear diary,

I found a little shack of some kind.

Along the way, I encountered a shopping cart. So 
my back will be relief of the loot burden.

I feel a bit better now. I hope this will last.

Dear diary,

I saw a group of beavers today.

I wish I would've give a dam, but no, so I moved 
on.

Dear diary,

I was looting an abandoned motel.

Place doesn't seems too shabby, other than the two
swimming zombies.

Goodness, I think that was my first
encounter with a zombie dressed with hard-plates 
all over.
